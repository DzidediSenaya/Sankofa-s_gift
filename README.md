## Project Story and Technical Details

### Inspiration

Sankofa's Gift stems from a deep desire to bring African heritage to life in a fun and interactive way. As someone passionate about cultural preservation, I embarked on this project to address the lack of African-centric games and edutainment concepts. My long-term vision involves collaborating with like-minded programmers to create more authentic educational African games.

### Technical Challenge

The most significant technical challenge revolved around issues with my virtual machine, hindering the download of essential dependencies. Faced with setbacks, I adopted alternative solutions, emphasizing results over excuses. This experience taught me resilience, the importance of having a plan B, and the necessity of thinking outside the box.

### Next Iteration

Looking ahead, I envision expanding Sankofa's Gift into a more sophisticated and visually appealing game. Incorporating advanced storytelling elements, diverse characters, and leveraging cutting-edge technologies will be key focus areas for the next iteration.
